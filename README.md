# HMRC Manuals API

This app provides URLs for pushing HMRC manuals to the GOV.UK Publishing API.

## Nomenclature

- **Manual**: HMRC manual with title and description, contains many Sections. See [Adding or updating a manual](docs/extended_documentation.md#adding-or-updating-a-manual) for more details. Before adding a manual through the api, a [new slug should be added](#adding-a-new-slug) to the list of known slugs.

- **Section**: Sections can contain sub-sections and/or a content body. See [Adding or updating a section](docs/extended_documentation.md#adding-or-updating-a-manual-section) for more details.

## Adding a new slug

Before adding a new manual through the api, the slug for the manual must be added to [/config/initializers/known_manual_slugs.rb](config/initializers/known_manual_slugs.rb) and the application re-deployed.

The workflow for this is likely to be initiated by a zendesk ticket raised by HMRC with the new slug. A developer can
then add the slug and re-deploy the application and inform HMRC that the slug is ready to be published against.

## Technical documentation

Provides an API for a system built by HMRC to publish tax manuals onto GOV.UK. In many ways it is analogous to a backend/admin app for publishing on GOV.UK. Content which passes validation and checks for unsanitary content is submitted to the GOV.UK Publishing API application. The application does not have a database itself. An HMRC manual consists of two document types: the manual itself and manual sections.
