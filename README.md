# HMRC Manuals API

This app provides URLs for pushing HMRC manuals to the GOV.UK Publishing API.

## Connecting to the API

The base path for the preview environment is:
https://hmrc-manuals-api.preview.alphagov.co.uk

Authentication is done with a token, which needs to be supplied in the Authorization HTTP header, like this:

```Authorization: Bearer your_token```

You also need to supply an accept header and a Content-Type header:

    Accept: application/json
    Content-Type: application/json

Please note that:
* Tokens are environment specific, so preview and production will have different tokens.
* The data on preview is overwritten every night with data from production

### HTTP Verbs

`PUT` is used for requests creating and modifying content. `POST` requests are also supported as a fallback if `PUT` requests are blocked by a firewall, for example. See the Service Manual for more detail: https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/making-software/apis.html#use-http-methods-as-tim-intended

## Adding or updating a manual

### Request

`PUT /hmrc-manuals/<slug>`.

The `<slug>` is used as part of the GOV.UK URL for the document.

### Example JSON

[See an example manual](/public/json_examples/requests/employment-income-manual.json)


###Â JSON Schema

[JSON Schema for manuals](public/manual-schema.json)

## Adding or updating a manual section

### Request

`PUT /hmrc-manuals/<manual-slug>/sections/<section_slug>`.

The `<manual-slug>` and `<section_slug>` will be used as part of the GOV.UK URL for the document. The `<section_slug>` will be the section ID converted to lowercase.

### Example JSON

1. [An example first-level section, with children](/public/json_examples/requests/employment-income-manual/eim11800.json)
1. [An example third-level section](/public/json_examples/requests/employment-income-manual/eim25525.json)
1. [An example section with ungrouped children](/public/json_examples/requests/employment-income-manual/eim11200.json) (the group title is omitted and only one group included)


### JSON Schema

## Possible responses to PUT requests

* `200`: updated successfully
* `201`: created successfully
  * Both `200`s and `201`s return a location header and a response body containing the GOV.UK URL of the manual:

    `Location: https://www.gov.uk/guidance/<manual_slug>/<section_slug>`
    ```json
    {
      "govuk_url": "https://www.gov.uk/guidance/<manual_slug>/<section_slug>"
    }
    ```
* `400`: the request JSON isn't well-formed.
* `409`: the slug is taken by content that is managed by another publishing tool.
* `422`: there's a validation error. A response body would detail the errors:

    ```json
    {
      "status": "error",
      "errors": [
        "error_message_1",
        "error_message_2",
        ...
      ]
    }
    ```

* `503`: the request could not be completed because the API or the Publishing API is unavailable.

## Slugs, section IDs and URLs

GOV.UK has URL standards to ensure that the URLs are SEO and user friendly. You
can read about them here: https://insidegovuk.blog.gov.uk/url-standards-for-gov-uk/

This API constructs the GOV.UK URLs based upon the slugs and section IDs supplied to it.

Slugs are validated to ensure that they fit the GOV.UK styleguide according to these rules:

* only lowercase letters, numbers and dashes are allowed
* no leading or trailing dashes

Additionally, users of the API are required to follow the styleguide for slugs:

* slugs should not contain acronyms wherever possible
* dashes should be used to separate words
* articles (a, an, the) and other superfluous words should not be used
* URLs should use the verb stem where possible: eg `apply` instead of `applying`
* no multiple consecutive dashes

Section IDs are validated to ensure that they can be converted to slugs by simply making them lowercase.

## Markup

All `description` and `body` attributes in manuals or manual sections may contain
[markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax). The markdown in those attributes
is converted to HTML before the document is sent to the Publishing API.

There is a whitelist of allowed HTML tags and attributes. If a manual or a section
contains any disallowed HTML in any field, the request is rejected with a validation error (status code `422`).

The following tags are allowed:

```
a, abbr, b, bdo, blockquote, br, caption, cite, code, col, colgroup, dd, del, dfn, div, dl, dt, em, figcaption, figure, h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6, hgroup, hr, i, img, ins, kbd, li, mark, ol, p, pre, q, rp, rt, ruby, s, samp, small, strike, strong, sub, sup, table, tbody, td, tfoot, th, thead, time, tr, u, ul, var, wbr.
```

The following tag attributes are allowed, by tag:

* `:all=>["dir", "lang", "title", "id", "class"]`
* `"a"=>["href", "rel"]`
* `"blockquote"=>["cite"]`
* `"col"=>["span", "width"]`
* `"colgroup"=>["span", "width"]`
* `"del"=>["cite", "datetime"]`
* `"img"=>["align", "alt", "height", "src", "width"]`
* `"ins"=>["cite", "datetime"]`
* `"ol"=>["start", "reversed", "type"]`
* `"q"=>["cite"]`
* `"table"=>["summary", "width"]`
* `"td"=>["abbr", "axis", "colspan", "rowspan", "width"]`
* `"th"=>["abbr", "axis", "colspan", "rowspan", "scope", "width"]`
* `"time"=>["datetime", "pubdate"]`
* `"ul"=>["type"]`

Images are only allowed if on a relative path (ie hosted on `www.gov.uk`) or on
the GOV.UK assets domain: `assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk`. Markup
containing images hosted on other domains will be rejected with a 422 error code.
