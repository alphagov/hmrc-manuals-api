# HMRC Manuals API

This app provides URLs for pushing HMRC manuals into the content store.

## Connecting to the API

The base path for the preview environment is:
https://hmrc-manuals-api.preview.alphagov.co.uk

Authentication is done with a token, which needs to be supplied in the Authorization HTTP header, like this:

```Authorization: Bearer your_token```

You also need to supply an accept header:

```Accept: application/json```

Please note that:
* Tokens are environment specific, so preview and production will have different tokens.
* The data on preview is overwritten every night with data from production

## Possible responses to PUT requests

* `200`: updated successfully
* `201`: created successfully
* `400`: the request JSON isn't well-formed.
* `409`: the slug is taken by content that is managed by another publishing tool.
* `422`: there's a validation error. A response body would detail the errors:

    ```json
    {
      "status": "error",
      "errors": [
        "error_message_1",
        "error_message_2",
        ...
      ]
    }
    ```

* `503`: the request could not be completed because the API or the content store is unavailable.

## Content validation

If a manual or a section contains any HTML tags in any field, the request is rejected with a status `422` validation error.
