The charge is not reduced at all unless the employee makes good the cost of all the fuel provided for private use. In particular, it is not reduced pound for pound to the extent that the employee makes good the fuel provided (see [EIM25650](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM25500#EIM25650)).\n\nOnly if the employee makes good the cost of all the fuel provided for private use is the car fuel benefit reduced to nil ([EIM25555](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM25500#EIM25555)).\n\n### Years prior to 2003/04\n\nThe fuel benefit charge had a different basis in these years.
